# python-pdf-merger-lewis-bull
This is a pdf merger that I created using the programming language python, it's main use is to merge pdfs into one file so that students have an easier time submitting work.
The merger relies on the PyPDF2 dependecy to work and is only a few lines of code, I created this to make myself more familiarised with different, usefull python libraries.
